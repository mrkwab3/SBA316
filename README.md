#DOM Manipulation
In this repository, i showcase my abilities when it comes to DOM Manipulation. This includes the ability to select elements, create elements,
iterate over nodelists, append elements to existing ones, and change the content of elements. By elements, i mean Node Elements which are elements
obtained from the DOM.
